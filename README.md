## Importance of of identifying design properties of a mock up design.
Identifying the design properties of a mock-up design is important because it clarifies the vision and ensures smooth communication among stakeholders, guides developers by providing actionable details like colors, fonts, spacing, and button styles, and maintains consistency across the product to strengthen branding and user experience. It also supports usability testing by checking readability, accessibility, and responsiveness before coding begins, which helps catch issues early. Ultimately, this process saves time and reduces costs by preventing redesigns and guesswork, ensuring the final product is clear, consistent, user-friendly, and aligned with both the design intent and business goals.
